# Facade
The facade design pattern provides a simplier interface to a more complex body of code.

It may seem very similar to the adapter pattern, but the key difference is that an adapter
is _adapting_ to one or more existing interfaces, whereas facade is concerned with providing a
new, less complex interface for clients to interact with.
