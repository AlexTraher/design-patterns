# Decorator
The decorator design pattern allows you to change the behaviour of an object by 
wrapping it in a decorator object.

Decorators provide a flexible way of extending the functionality of a class at runtime.

One of the key differences between this and the bridge pattern is that this allows any
combination as long as it includes the simpliest implementation, whereas the bridge pattern
defines multiple hierachies, where one hierachy expects an object from the other.
