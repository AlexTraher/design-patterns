# Observer 
The Observer design pattern, also known as the pub-sub pattern allows a single publisher (pub) to notify many subscribers (subs) of things they are interested in, rather than relying on the subscribers themselves to check on a property they care about.

In practice this means that a publisher has a subscribe method, which allows subscribers to listen for changes they care about. If those changes occur, the pusblisher will notify the subscriber that a change has occured.
