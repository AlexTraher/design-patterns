# Strategy 
The Strategy design pattern allows a client to dynamically decide on an implmentation at runtime. For example, choosing a different sorting algorithm based on the list size.

In practice this design pattern is very similar to the state design pattern, but the key difference is in _intent_. In the state design pattern, we are trying to help an object manage state (duh!), however in the strategy design pattern, we are giving an object the ability to choose different implementations depending on conditions.
