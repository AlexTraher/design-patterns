# Mediator
The mediator design pattern allows decoupling of classes from each other by providing a `mediator` class which handles all the interation between the objects.

This is particularly useful when there are many classes that tightly coupled. By providing a mediator, each class only has to interact with the mediator class, which managing what to do with that interaction, including interacting with other classes.
The real value of this design pattern is decoupling components from each other.
