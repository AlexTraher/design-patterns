# Iterator
The iterator design pattern aims to provide a consistent interface for a client to interact with a collection. A collection could take many forms, it may be a simple list, a tree, graph, stack or any of many other data structures. The iterator pattern allows the underlying data structure to be irrelevant to a client interacting with the elements.

It works by definining one (or more) iterators for a collection. These objects allow you to get the next element in the collection until there are no more elements to get. The iterator class encapsulates the logic required to traverse the collection itself.
