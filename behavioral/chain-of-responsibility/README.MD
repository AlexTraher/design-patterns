# Chain of Responsibility
The Chain of responsibility design pattern allows you to create a chain of receiver objects for a request. The request enters one end of the chain and keeps going until it finds a suitable handler.

In practice, it works by each object in the chain defining a subsequent handler that it will defer to if it cannot handle the request.
