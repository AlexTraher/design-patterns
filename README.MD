# Design Patterns
This repo is aimed to be a learning exercise, and hopefully a handy reference of how to write some common design patterns in JavaScript.

It includes examples of all 23 [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) design patterns.

## Credit

There is an individual README for each pattern, including references for sources that I found useful when reading up on them, but a special mention goes to:

1. [JS Design patterns for Humans](https://github.com/sohamkamani/javascript-design-patterns-for-humans)
2. [Design Patterns JS](https://github.com/fbeline/Design-Patterns-JS)

Which have been particularly useful as a starting point for almost all of these design patterns.
